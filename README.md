  <i>Deep learning based vulnerability detection model</i>
</p>

## Introduction
CONCOCTION is an automated machine learning based vulnerability detection 
framework. This is the first DL system to learn program presentations by 
combining static source code information and dynamic program execution 
traces.


## Installation

Concoction builds upon:
-	Python v3.6
	
The system was tested on the following operating systems:
- Ubuntu 18.04

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for further details.

## Useage

See [USAGE.md](./usage.md) for a step-by-step demo of Concoction.

## Data

Data are available at [here](./dataset/README.md).

## Main Results
Full list of code vulnerabilities discovered by Concoction can be found [here](./vul_info/README.md).
